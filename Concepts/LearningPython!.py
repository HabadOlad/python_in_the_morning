#this is a comment in python

'''
This is a multi line comment in python ,

although technically they are string literals,

but can be used as comments if they are not assigned to a variable

In fact, it’s now fairly safe to say that Python
 played a pivotal role in changing the world. 
 By spearheading a shift from statically typed compiled languages to dynamically typed scripting languages, 
 Python ushered in changes that were at least as profound as those of the earlier transition from 
 machine language to compiled languages.

'''
Compiled Languages: In a compiled language, the entire
source code is translated into machine code by a
program called a compiler before the program is 
run. This results in a standalone executable file
(like an .exe on Windows).Workflow: Code $\rightarrow$ Compiler $\rightarrow$ Executable File $\rightarrow$ Output.
Performance: Generally much faster because the translation is done once, and the computer runs the pre-optimized machine code directly.
Error Detection: Errors are caught during the "build" phase. 
If there is a syntax error, the program won't even finish compiling.Examples: C, C++, Rust, Go, Swift.

Interpreted Languages
In an interpreted language, 
the source code is not translated all at once. Instead, 
a program called an interpreter reads and executes the code 
line-by-line, on the fly, as the program is running.Workflow: Code $\rightarrow$ Interpreter $\rightarrow$ Output.
Performance: Typically slower because the computer has to translate each line of code every time it runs.
Error Detection: Errors are caught at "runtime." The program will start running and only crash when it hits the specific 
line containing the error.
Examples: Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP.
